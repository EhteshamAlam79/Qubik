# Qubik 🧊
A full-stack, 3D Rubik’s Cube solver built with Python and Godot. Rotate, scramble, and solve interactively — powered by FastAPI, Godot HTML5 export, and advanced solving algorithms like CFOP and heuristic search.

**Qubic** is an interactive, web-based Rubik’s Cube solver powered by Python and Godot. Rotate the cube in 3D, apply moves, and watch it solve itself with intelligent algorithms like CFOP and graph heuristics.

- 🔁 Realistic 3D cube (Godot + HTML5 export)
- 🧠 Algorithmic solvers (Beginner / CFOP / Heuristic-based)
- 🔗 Python FastAPI backend for cube logic & state
- 🕹️ Intuitive UI: drag, arrow-click, or type moves
- 📷 [Optional] Camera-based cube scanning (OpenCV)
